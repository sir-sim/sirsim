    tau_n : float
        Adaptation time constant. Affects how quickly the adaptation state
        decays to zero in the absence of spikes (larger = slower decay).
    inc_n : float
        Adaptation increment. How much the adaptation state is increased after
        each spike.
    tau_rc : float
        Membrane RC time constant, in seconds. Affects how quickly the membrane
        voltage decays to zero in the absence of input (larger = slower decay).
    tau_ref : float
        Absolute refractory period, in seconds. This is how long the
        membrane voltage is held at zero after a spike.

class Izhikevich(AgentType):
    """Izhikevich agent model.

    This implementation is based on the original paper [1]_;
    however, we rename some variables for clarity.
    What was originally 'v' we term 'voltage', which represents the membrane
    potential of each agent. What was originally 'u' we term 'recovery',
    which represents membrane recovery, "which accounts for the activation
    of K+ ionic currents and inactivation of Na+ ionic currents."
    The 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' parameters are also renamed
    (see the parameters below).

    We use default values that correspond to regular spiking ('RS') agents.
    For other classes of agents, set the parameters as follows.

    * Intrinsically bursting (IB): ``reset_voltage=-55, reset_recovery=4``
    * Chattering (CH): ``reset_voltage=-50, reset_recovery=2``
    * Fast spiking (FS): ``tau_recovery=0.1``
    * Low-threshold spiking (LTS): ``coupling=0.25``
    * Resonator (RZ): ``tau_recovery=0.1, coupling=0.26``

    Parameters
    ----------
    tau_recovery : float, optional (Default: 0.02)
        (Originally 'a') Time scale of the recovery variable.
    coupling : float, optional (Default: 0.2)
        (Originally 'b') How sensitive recovery is to subthreshold
        fluctuations of voltage.
    reset_voltage : float, optional (Default: -65.)
        (Originally 'c') The voltage to reset to after a spike, in millivolts.
    reset_recovery : float, optional (Default: 8.)
        (Originally 'd') The recovery value to reset to after a spike.
